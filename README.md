# Normal_incidence_DBR
The software **Normal_incidence_DBR** is a standalone Python application that plots the reflectance and transmittance of a lossless distributed Bragg reflector. All the requirements are bundled-in and it does not require Python or package installation when run through `Normal_incidence_DBR.exe`. The figure below shows the app interface with the parameter fields on the left and the plots on the right.
